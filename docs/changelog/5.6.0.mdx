## Headless CMS

### The Reference Field Can Now Reference Different Content Models ([#1572](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1572))

A feature that has been frequently requested is finally here!

Within a single reference field, you can now reference content entries that are created of multiple different content models.

For example, here we are adding the **Published Work** reference field to the existing **Author** content model. Notice how we've picked not one, but three different content models in the **Content Models** field: **Book**, **Video**, and **Music**.

<CenteredImage alt="Reference Field - Adding Multiple Different Content Models" src={cmsRefMultipleModels} />

This means that, while managing authors, users will be able to select multiple book, video, and music entries, all referenced via the single **Published Work** reference field.

### Added Ability To Change Content Model Group ([#1591](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1591))

Upon creating a content model, users are required to select a content model group, into which their new content model will be put. But, if later down the road, users decided to change the group, they wouldn't be able to do it via user interface.

To address this issue, in the Headless CMS content model editor, a new form field was added to the settings section, allowing us to change the group if needed.

## Page Builder

### Added Visibility Element Setting in the Editor([#1579](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1579))

Now, you can set the visibility of an element using the _Visibility setting_ in the page editor sidebar.

### Added Navigator in the Editor([#1579](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1579))

Quickly see the hierarchy structure of the page in a tree view.
You can also:
- reorder block by drag and drop
- select and unhide elements that are set hidden previously
- quickly jump between elements

## Webiny CLI

### Improved Watch Command With Brand New `browser` Output


## File Manager

### Fixed Uploading Files With Less Standard Extensions([#1577](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1577))

When in File Manager, uploading files with a less standard file extension would fail. This is no longer the case.

## Other

### Migrating Config Files to TypeScript

For a very long time, our wish was to have Webiny projects be 100% TypeScript. And while that was to a large degree true, there were still a couple of pieces missing.

So, with this release, we migrated all of the different JavaScript configuration files to TypeScript. These include:

- `webiny.project.ts` - located in your project root
- `webiny.application.ts` - located within project application folders (e.g. [`api/webiny.application.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/webiny.application.ts))
- `webiny.config.ts` - located within all packages in your Webiny project

Note that the existing JavaScript configuration files will still work. You're not forced to migrate if you don't want to or it's not that important.
