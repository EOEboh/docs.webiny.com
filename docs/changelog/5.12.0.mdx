### Ability to Define Content Models and Content Model Groups via Plugins ([#1797](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1797))

In this release, we've introduced the ability to define content models and content model groups via plugins. This brings a couple of cool benefits, like having both stored in your version control, in some cases additional flexibility, and more.
