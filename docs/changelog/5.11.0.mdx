# Changes

This document highlights the most important fixes, improvements, and features, that were introduced in Webiny `5.11.0`.

:::info How To Upgrade?

Please check the [Webiny 5.11.0 migration guide](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/5.10.0-to-5.11.0) for the upgrade steps.

## Development

### Pulumi v3 Upgrade ([#1787](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1787))

From now on, all Webiny projects will use [Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi) v3.

For Webiny users, this will make it possible to have access to all of the new features and fixes that the framework will receive in the future.

In terms of existing projects and upgrading, there shouldn't be any major changes or extra steps that you'll need to perform. But, there are a couple of things to have in mind. Be sure to check the [upgrade guide](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/5.10.0-to-5.11.0) for more information.

### Improved CI/CD Scaffolds ([#1786](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1786))

A couple of useful updates were made to the existing CI/CD scaffold.

#### Updates to the Pull Requests Workflows

The pull request workflow that gets created during the scaffolding process will now make sure that all of the changes are deployed into a short-lived environment. This makes it possible for the team to check out all of the changes on their own, before the PR is merged. And, once the PR is either merged or simply closed, the short-lived environment will automatically be destroyed.


#### Improved Testing

Prior to this release, with the single `yarn test` command, the created workflows would run all of your application tests immediately - unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E).

This has now been divided into separate commands, so the three types of tests will be run separately, and most importantly, in the right order. For example, we cannot run integration tests before our project has been deployed.
