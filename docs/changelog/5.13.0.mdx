## Development

### Three New Scaffolds ([#1839](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1839))

The highlight of this release - we bring you three brand new scaffolds that are mainly focused on aiding developers in custom application development. The three scaffolds are:

- New Full Stack Application
- New GraphQL API
- New React Application

To get started, simply run the existing `webiny scaffold` command and pick the scaffold you need. You can also check out the linked guides to learn more.

### New `types.ts` Declaration File In GraphQL API Application Code ([#1839](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1839))

Write this.

### Custom AWS Profiles Work Now Work As Expected ([#1839](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1839))

Write this.

## Page Builder

### Pages Rendering - Meta Data Injected At The Top of the HTML Document ([#1865](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1865))

Write this.

### Yarn 3 Support ([#1862](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1862))
You can now use Yarn 3 with your existing projects, and all new Webiny projects will be created with Yarn 3. Yarn project is using the codename **berry** for all their releases. To prevent unexpected problems as major version releases occur, our CLI and **create-webiny-project** utility will have the supported versions of Yarn whitelisted. Currently, we allow versions 2 and 3, and we'll keep adding new versions when they arrive, only after thorough testing.

### Fix `watch` on Windows ([#1848](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1848))
There's currently a bug in the Pulumi path detection for file watching, so on Windows, where paths start with **C:**, etc., Pulumi thinks it's a relative path, and constructs a wrong file path to watch. To bypass this issue, and get the [watch](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/use-watch-command/#webiny-watch-command) command to work on Windows, we've temporarily disabled path filtering on Windows.

Watch works just a good, but you might experience a case of double update on Lambda functions. Not a major problem, just a little detail you'll most likely not even notice, if you don't pay attention to deploy logs.

### Allow Links To Be Rendered in the Menu Group ([#1857](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1857))
With the introduction of [Webiny UI Composer](/docs/key-topics/ui-composer/introduction), in Admin Area, navigation menu items are now rendered using the new concept of [renderers](/docs/key-topics/ui-composer/creating-elements#enabling-support-for-renderers). Unfortunately, it did not include a renderer for links as a direct child of a menu group. With this release, we've improved one of the renderers to handle both 2-level and 3-level menu hierarchy.


### Add `.mjs` Webpack Rule ([#1852](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1852))
When including a third-party dependency into your GraphQL Lambda functions, if that dependency uses JS modules (`.mjs` extension), webpack bundling would fail. We've now added a rule to properly bundle `.mjs` files.

Shout out to [@econtentmaps](https://github.com/econtentmaps) for testing the fix! :raised_hands: :heart:
