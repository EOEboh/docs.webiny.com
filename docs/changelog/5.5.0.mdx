# Changes

This document highlights the most important fixes, improvements, and features, that were introduced in Webiny `5.5.0`.

## Webiny CLI

### Brand New `webiny watch` Command [(#1540)](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1540)

The brand new `webiny watch` command brings local development experience to a whole new level!

#### How We Currently Do It

Let’s say you wanted to expand the default GraphQL API, that’s deployed as part of the [API](/docs/key-topics/cloud-infrastructure/api/introduction) project application. At the moment, in order to do that, you’d have make the following steps:

- start a watch session on relevant packages using the [`webiny workspaces run`](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/working-with-workspaces) command
- make your code changes
- deploy them using the [`yarn webiny deploy api --env {your-environment}`](#) command
- repeat

This is not ideal for a couple of reasons:

- you're required to manually execute the `webiny deploy` command all the time
- the `webiny deploy` command always builds all of the project application's packages at the beginning, which can be really slow
- apart from running the `webiny deploy`, you also need to separately run the mentioned `webiny workspaces run` command, in order to establish watch session on packages you're working on

#### The New Way

From now on, you'll be able to just run the `yarn webiny watch api --env {your-environment}` command and start coding! The command will automatically start watching all of the relevant packages (no matter where they’re located in your Webiny project) and also re-deploy only relevant cloud infrastructure resources (e.g. a single Lambda function), as needed.

#### Logs

And there's actually more! By simply appending the `--logs` argument to the `webiny watch` command, you also gain the ability to stream all logs from your application code (Lambda functions), directly to your terminal:

This basically means no more digging through [Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) logs while developing or debugging your backend application code.

#### Learn More

To learn more about the new `webiny watch` command, check out the newly added [Local Development](#) guide.

### Introduced New `webiny workspaces tree` Command [(#1540)](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1540)

The new `webiny workspaces tree` command gives you an overview of all packages that exist within your Webiny project and how they depend on each other.

For additional information and usage examples, simply type the following command in your terminal of choice:

```bash
yarn webiny ws tree --help
```

# Project Organization

### Added `webiny.application.js` File [(#1540)](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1540)

Description.

### Locally Stored State Files Moved To Project Root [(#1540)](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1540)

Description.

# How To Upgrade

On the other hand, if you’re coming with an older version of Webiny, before upgrading, make sure to check our [How To Upgrade](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview) guide.

Once you go through these, all it remains is running the following commands, as usual:

- `yarn up "@webiny/*@5.5.0"`
- `yarn webiny deploy`
