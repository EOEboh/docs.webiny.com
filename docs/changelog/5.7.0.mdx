## Webiny CLI

### Brand new CI/CD Scaffold ([#1633](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1633))

With this release, we're introducing a brand new CI/CD scaffold, which will set up a CI/CD workflow for your Webiny project in no time!

<CenteredImage title="New CI/CD Scaffold" src={cicdScaffold}/>

Currently, you can set up your CI/CD via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) only. But note that in the future, we would certainly like to bring support for more providers, depending on the interest from the community.

For more information on how to use the new scaffold, make sure to check out the also new [Set up CI/CD](#/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/ci-cd) how-to guide.

:::tip
If you plan to use a different CI/CD provider, you can still create your workflows manually, by following all of the recommendations outlined in the new [CI/CD](#/docs/key-topics/ci-cd/introduction) key topics section. Also, if you think your provider should be supported out of the box, please [open an issue](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues/new) or [contact us](https://www.webiny.com/slack).
