## Webiny CLI

### Brand new CI/CD Scaffold ([#1633](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1633))

With this release, we're introducing a brand new CI/CD scaffold, which will set up a CI/CD workflow for your Webiny project in no time!

<CenteredImage title="New CI/CD Scaffold" src={cicdScaffold}/>

Currently, you can set up your CI/CD via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) only. But note that in the future, we would certainly like to bring support for more providers, depending on the interest from the community.

For more information on how to use the new scaffold, make sure to check out the also new [Set up CI/CD](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/ci-cd) how-to guide.

:::tip
If you plan to use a different CI/CD provider, you can still create your workflows manually, by following all of the recommendations outlined in the new [CI/CD](/docs/key-topics/ci-cd/introduction) key topics section. Also, if you think your provider should be supported out of the box, please [open an issue](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues/new) or [contact us](https://www.webiny.com/slack).

### Improved `--debug` Argument (`webiny deploy` and `webiny destroy` Commands)  ([#1624](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1624), [@ankurvr](https://github.com/ankurvr))

From this release, passing the `--debug` flag upon running the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) and [`webiny destroy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/destroy-cloud-infrastructure) commands will also include additional deployment-related information and logs.

The following example shows how you can use it with the `webiny deploy` command:

```bash
yarn webiny deploy api --env dev --debug
```

This improvement will be very useful because without it, upon experiencing deployment-related errors, users simply wouldn't receive enough information, which would make debugging much harder and in certain cases, even almost impossible.

## Documentation

### New CI/CD Key Topics

We've just published the brand new [CI/CD](/docs/key-topics/ci-cd/introduction) key topics section, which, as you might've already guessed, covers everything that there is to know about setting up a CI/CD workflow for your Webiny projects.
