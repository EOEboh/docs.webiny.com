# Changes

## Headless CMS

### Fixed Search Bar [(#1532)](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1532)

### Improved the `contains` GraphQL Operator [(#1531)](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1531)


## Webiny CLI

### Improved Error Reporting [(#1526)](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1526)

We've noticed that, in certain cases, it can get a bit hard to understand the error that occurred in user's terminal. A typical example is the `SubscriptionRequiredException` error, which, without doing some googling, mean nothing to the user.

# How To Upgrade

If you are already using Webiny version 5.2.x, there are no special migration steps that need to be taken. So, if you are ready to upgrade, in your terminal of choice, simply run the following commands:

- `yarn up "@webiny/\*@5.3.0"`
- `yarn webiny deploy`

On the other hand, if youâ€™re coming with an older version of Webiny, before upgrading, make sure to check our [How To Upgrade](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview) guide.
