:::tip WHAT YOUâ€™LL LEARN
- how to extend the Admin Area React application
:::

## Extending the Admin Area React Application

By default, every Webiny project comes with a fully working Admin Area React application, which enables project administrators to manage content coming from one or more Webiny applications, like [Headless CMS](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-cms), [Page Builder](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-cms), [File Manager](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-cms), and so on. And while these applications do offer a solid number of features and can also be extended to a certain extent, there are still cases where creating custom standalone Admin Area modules makes more sense.

For example, let's imagine we're working on a custom Car Manufacturers module, which lets us perform basic CRUD operations, includes a set of operations that need to follow specific business logic rules, security requirements, may interact with external APIs and services, and so on.

Extending the existing Webiny applications may work, but still, by creating a standalone Admin Area, we receive additional application code flexibility and easier maintenance. And, with the help of existing [Extend Admin Area](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/extend-admin-area) scaffold, we can really start working on a new module in no time, with all of the right development workflows in place.



<!-- ## Prerequisites -->

<!-- Before you start this tutorial, make sure that you have Webiny installed. -->

<!-- You can read on how to install it in our [Install Webiny](/docs/tutorials/install-webiny) article. -->

<!-- ## Scaffold -->

<!-- Scaffolding is the easiest way to build apps and APIs in Webiny. -->
<!-- Using a scaffold you will generate your app or an API. -->
<!-- You will get all of the required code automatically created for you. -->
<!-- This is a great starting point, as then you can just modify and adapt the code to your needs, without dealing with much of the boilerplate work. -->

<!-- There are several scaffolds that ship with Webiny, including the Admin area scaffold and the API scaffold, which we will explore more in this tutorial. -->
<!-- All scaffolds have a wizard that guides you through the process by asking you a set of simple questions. -->
<!-- More on that in the actual tutorial. -->

<!-- :::note -->
<!-- You can add your own custom scaffolds by building a [CLI plugin](/docs/tutorials/webiny-cli/adding-custom-commands) and using the current scaffold plugin as a [reference](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/src/index.ts). -->

<!-- ## Workspaces -->

<!-- We link all our packages to `node_modules` via workspaces (read about them in yarn [docs](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)), so we can use their name to import them in our applications. -->
<!-- Packages are linked by default via `yarn postinstall`. If you want to link them manually, run `yarn link-packages`. -->
<!-- :::note -->
<!-- By default, the packages located in `./packages/` directory are linked. If you want to create a package that is outside that directory, you must add yours to the linkPackages script. -->

<!-- The script is located in `./scripts/linkWorkspaces.js`. You must add your directory into the `whitelist` array, otherwise package linking will not pick up your packages. -->
