## Overview

With the Hosted UI authentication flow successfully integrated into our React application, we're now finally ready to start implementing authentication and authorization checks in our GraphQL API. But, before we do that, we need to perform a couple of initial setup steps.

First of all, we'll add two new libraries that will make it a bit easier to work with the current user within our GraphQL API code (resolver functions). Once that's in place, we will perform the following:

- perform a minor update to our cloud infrastructure code
- set up the added packages (plugins)
- perform a minor but important update to the [`Context`](#) interface
- add new [`createdBy`](#) field to our main [`Pin`](#) GraphQL type

Let's see how we can achieve all of these.

## 1. Adding the Needed Packages

In order to implement the necessary authentication and authorization checks within our GraphQL API, like in the previous section, let's again start by adding a couple of new packages into the mix.

#### [`@webiny/api-security`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-security)

A collection of plugins that will set up the [Webiny Security Framework](https://www.webiny.com/docs/key-topics/security-framework/introduction) in our GraphQL API handler function.

#### [`@webiny/api-security-cognito-authentication`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-security-cognito-authentication)

By itself, the above package doesn't do much. It's simply a framework, which is always paired with an authentication provider. In our case, we want to pair it up with the Amazon Cognito provider, which is what this package does.

The following command will add both packages to our React application:

```bash
yarn workspace pinterest-clone-api add @webiny/api-security @webiny/api-security-cognito-authentication
```

## 2. Updating Cloud Infrastructure Code

In order to start setting up the newly added packages, we'll first need to update our cloud infrastructure code.

More specifically, we'll need to pass two new environment variables to our GraphQL API handler function: `COGNITO_REGION` and `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`.

```ts title="pinterest-clone/api/pulumi/dev/index.ts" {29-30}
import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
import DynamoDB from "./dynamoDb";
import Graphql from "./graphql";
import ApiGateway from "./apiGateway";
import Cloudfront from "./cloudfront";
import Cognito from "./cognito";
import S3 from "./s3";

// Among other things, this determines the amount of information we reveal on runtime errors.
// https://www.webiny.com/docs/how-to-guides/environment-variables/#debug-environment-variable
const DEBUG = String(process.env.DEBUG);

// Enables logs forwarding.
// https://www.webiny.com/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command#enabling-logs-forwarding
const WEBINY_LOGS_FORWARD_URL = String(process.env.WEBINY_LOGS_FORWARD_URL);

export default () => {
    const cognito = new Cognito();
    const dynamoDb = new DynamoDB();
    const s3 = new S3();

    const api = new Graphql({
        dbTable: dynamoDb.table,
        cognitoUserPool: cognito.userPool,
        s3Bucket: s3.bucket,
        env: {
            // The single DynamoDB table in which data can be stored and queried.
            DB_TABLE: dynamoDb.table.name,
            COGNITO_REGION: String(process.env.AWS_REGION),
            COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID: cognito.userPool.id,
            DEBUG,
            WEBINY_LOGS_FORWARD_URL
        }
    });

    (...)
};
```

As we'll soon see, in our application code, these will be passed to our GraphQL API handler function, upon configuring the relevant security plugins.

:::note
In order for the new environment variables to be available in our GraphQL API handler function, we'll need to redeploy it. If you had a watch session already up and running, this should've happened automatically. Otherwise, you'll need to either start a new session via the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command), or simply deploy the change via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) command.
:::

## 3. Setting Up the Packages (Plugins)

Essentially, both [`@webiny/api-security`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-security) and [`@webiny/api-security-cognito-authentication`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-security-cognito-authentication) packages are exporting a collection of plugins, which are meant to be registered within our GraphQL API handler function:

```ts title="pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql/src/index.ts" {4,5,18,24-37}
import { createHandler } from "@webiny/handler-aws";
import graphqlPlugins from "@webiny/handler-graphql";
import logsPlugins from "@webiny/handler-logs";
import securityPlugins, { SecurityIdentity } from "@webiny/api-security";
import cognitoAuthenticationPlugins from "@webiny/api-security-cognito-authentication";

// Imports plugins created via scaffolding utilities.
import scaffoldsPlugins from "./plugins/scaffolds";

const debug = process.env.DEBUG === "true";

export const handler = createHandler({
  plugins: [
    /**
     * Setup Webiny Security Framework to handle authentication and authorization.
     * Learn more: https://www.webiny.com/docs/key-topics/security-framework/introduction
     */
    securityPlugins(),

    /**
     * Cognito authentication plugin.
     * This plugin will verify the JWT token against a provided User Pool.
     */
    cognitoAuthenticationPlugins({
      region: process.env.COGNITO_REGION,
      userPoolId: process.env.COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID,
      identityType: "user",
      getIdentity({ identityType, token }) {
        return new SecurityIdentity({
          id: token["cognito:username"],
          type: identityType,
          displayName: `${token.given_name} ${token.family_name}`,
          firstName: token.given_name,
          lastName: token.family_name,
        });
      },
    }),
    logsPlugins(),
    graphqlPlugins({ debug }),
    scaffoldsPlugins(),
  ],
  http: { debug },
});
```

As we can see, via the [`securityPlugins`](#) function call, we're first registering the plugins that set up the [Webiny Security Framework](https://www.webiny.com/docs/key-topics/security-framework/introduction). No additional configuration parameters need to be passed here.

Then, via the [`cognitoAuthenticationPlugins`](#) function call, we're registering another set of plugins that will, basically, enable us to perform authentication against Amazon Cognito and the User Pool we've defined in a [previous section](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/security/adding-user-pool-and-user-pool-domain).

### Configuration Parameters

Except assigning the newly added environment variables to `region` and `userPoolId` properties, in the [`cognitoAuthenticationPlugins`](#) function call, we're also assigning `"user"` to `identityType`, and our own custom callback function to the `getIdentity` property.

#### `identityType`

The `identityType` is a simple string that can, down the road, tell us what type of an identity we're working with and which authentication provider managed to authenticate it. For us, this is not that important, as we only have a single type of a user and only a single [`@webiny/api-security-cognito-authentication`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-security-cognito-authentication) authentication provider. But, since the `identityType` is a required property, we had to set it to something, so we simply passed `"user"` here.

#### `getIdentity`

Optionally, the `getIdentity` callback function enables us to return a custom [`SecurityIdentity`](#) instance once the identity has been successfully authenticated. This is helpful when we want to define additional properties on it, or maybe decide to assign a different value to the required ones - `id`, `type`, and `displayName`.

In our case, the reason we went with a custom `getIdentity` callback function is because, by default, the `id` property of the [`SecurityIdentity`](#) instance will be mapped to signed-in user's e-mail address, which is not what we want. Be relying on the `cognito:username` property of the received and decoded authorization token (notice the `token` named parameter), we're relying on an ID that was generated on the Amazon Cognito side.

:::info
The [`SecurityIdentity`](#) instance that we return from the `setIdentity` callback function is what we'll be returned to us while performing authentication down the road, for example within our GraphQL resolver functions. More on this in the following section of this tutorial.
:::

## 4. Updating `Context` Interface

The following step is not required, but it's certainly recommended because we'll benefit from improved type-safety and easier use.

If we were to open the [`pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql/src/types.ts`](#) file, in it, we'd find the [`Context`](#) interface, which we can utilize any time we're actually interacting with the handler's central `context` object. In our case, this would be within our GraphQL resolver functions, but it could also happen in different [`ContextPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/cli-scaffold-react-app/packages/handler/src/plugins/ContextPlugin.ts#L7), [`GraphQLSchemaPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.11.0/packages/handler-graphql/src/plugins/GraphQLSchemaPlugin.ts#L10), and other plugins.

So, since the newly added packages (sets of plugins) are actually modifying the `context` object by adding new properties to it, let's make sure those changes are reflected in the `Context` interface as well.

```ts title="pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql/src/types.ts" {5,18}
import { HandlerContext } from "@webiny/handler/types";
import { HttpContext } from "@webiny/handler-http/types";
import { ArgsContext } from "@webiny/handler-args/types";
import { ClientContext } from "@webiny/handler-client/types";
import { SecurityContext } from "@webiny/api-security/types";

// When working with the `context` object (for example while defining a new GraphQL resolver function),
// you can import this interface and assign it to it. This will give you full autocomplete functionality
// and type safety. The easiest way to import it would be via the following import statement:
// import { Context } from "~/types";
// Feel free to extend it with additional context interfaces, if needed. Also, please do not change the
// name of the interface, as existing scaffolding utilities may rely on it during the scaffolding process.
export interface Context
  extends HandlerContext,
    HttpContext,
    ArgsContext,
    ClientContext,
    SecurityContext {}
```

As we can see, at the top of the file, we've simply imported the `SecurityContext` interface, and then, below, added it to our `Context` interface. Which means that, from now on, every time we interact with the `context` object, we'll be able to safely access all of the additional properties that the newly added security-related plugins defined.

## 5. Adding `createdBy` Field

With all of the above steps correctly performed, we should be able to retrieve the signed-in user and perform essential authentication and authorization checks within our GraphQL resolver functions. Which means that, upon creating a new pin (via the [`createPin`](#) mutation), we'll also be able to tie the signed-in user to it.

In order to do this, we need to expand the [`Pin`](#) entity, and the [`PinEntity`](#) type with a new field, which we'll store the signed-in user information.

So, as the final step in this section of the tutorial, let's add the `createdBy` field which will be responsible for storing signed-in user information. In terms of the data type, the field will accept an object that consists of three properties: `id`, `displayName`, and `type`.

```ts title="pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/pins/entities/Pin.ts" {25}
// https://github.com/jeremydaly/dynamodb-toolbox
import { Entity } from "dynamodb-toolbox";
import table from "./table";
import { PinEntity } from "../types";

/**
 * Once we have the table, we define the PinEntity entity.
 * If needed, additional entities can be defined using the same approach.
 */
export default new Entity<PinEntity>({
    table,
    name: "Pin",
    timestamps: false,
    attributes: {
        PK: { partitionKey: true },
        SK: { sortKey: true },
        id: { type: "string" },
        title: { type: "string" },
        description: { type: "string" },
        coverImage: { type: "string" },
        createdOn: { type: "string" },
        savedOn: { type: "string" },

        // For the `Pin` entity, we can use a simple "map" type as the attribute type.
        createdBy: { type: "map" },

        // Will store current version of Webiny, for example "5.9.1".
        // Might be useful in the future or while performing upgrades.
        webinyVersion: { type: "string" }
    }
});
```

```ts title="pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/pins/types.ts" {1,14}
import { SecurityIdentity } from "@webiny/api-security";

export interface PinEntity {
    PK: string;
    SK: string;
    id: string;
    title: string;
    description?: string;
    coverImage?: string;
    createdOn: string;
    savedOn: string;

    // For the `PinEntity` type, let's be specific and specify which fields are accepted.
    createdBy: Pick<SecurityIdentity, "id" | "type" | "displayName">;

    webinyVersion: string;
}
```

:::info In Case You Forgot
In the [GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/graphql-api) section of this tutorial, we've used the [Extend GraphQL API](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/extend-graphql-api) scaffold to extend our GraphQL API and introduce essential CRUD GraphQL queries and mutations.

By default, the application code relies on [DynamoDB Toolbox](https://github.com/jeremydaly/dynamodb-toolbox), which is a library that makes it a bit easier to interact with the [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/features/) database. The `Entity` class we've seen in the above code sample is part of it.

:::

### TypeDefs

```graphql title="pinterest-clone/api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/pins/typeDefs.ts" {9,12-16}
export default /* GraphQL */ `
    type Pin {
        id: ID!
        title: String!
        description: String
        coverImage: String
        createdOn: DateTime!
        savedOn: DateTime!
        createdBy: PinCreatedBy
    }

    type PinCreatedBy {
        id: String
        type: String
        displayName: String
    }

    (...)
`;
```

## Final Result

With all of the above-shown changes in place, the initial setup is complete, which means we're finally ready to start implementing authentication and authorization checks in our GraphQL resolvers.

Note that the setup is only performed once. After that, the majority of security-related tasks will revolve around implementing proper authentication and authorization checks.
