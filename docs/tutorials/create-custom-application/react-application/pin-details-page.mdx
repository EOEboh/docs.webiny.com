## Overview

In the previous [Extending GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/extending-graphql-api) section, we've extended our GraphQL API with the new `Pin` GraphQL type and a basic set of related CRUD query and mutations operations. Now it's time to start building our frontend React application.

Essentially, the application will consist of the following two pages:

1. a list of all pins, created by different users:

<CenteredImage src={viewPins} alt="The Pinterest Clone Application" />


2. the pin details page:

<CenteredImage shadow={viewPins} alt="Viewing a Pin" src={viewPin} />

With these two pages, we'll also have to create a simple **New Pin** modal dialog that will enable users to create new pins:

Before we start any coding, let's quickly outline the plan.

## The Plan

As seen in the [Getting Started](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/getting-started) section, the [Full Stack Application](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/full-stack-application) scaffold also created a new React application for us, inside the [`pinterest-clone/app`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app), with the actual code located in the [`pinterest-clone/app/code`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/tree/master/create-custom-application/02-getting-started/pinterest-clone/app/code) folder:

```bash title="React Application Files and Folders (Some Files Removed for Brevity)"
pinterest-clone/app
├── code
│   ├── public                    # Contains initial HTML file and meta files.
│   ├── src                       # React application code.
│   │   ├── components            # Shared components go here.
│   │   ├── images                # Images go here.
│   │   ├── plugins               # All plugins go here.
│   │   ├── styles                # All SCSS styles go here.
│   │   ├── App.scss              # SCSS styles entrypoint file.
│   │   ├── App.tsx               # Contains root `App` React component.
│   │   ├── apollo.ts             # Sets up the Apollo GraphQL client.
│   │   └── index.tsx             # Application entrypoint file.
├── pulumi                        # Cloud infrastructure code.
└── webiny.application.ts         # Project application's manifest file.
```

This is where we'll build our application and we'll build it in the following order.

### 1. Create the Basic Layout

By default, the created React application contains its own layout, styles and some components. So, we'll want to make some adaptations here, remove some existing code, and add some new. For example, we'll need to install the mentioned [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) React library and import it in our application code.

### 2. Create the New Pin Modal Dialog

Once we have the layout ready, we will continue by creating the New Pin modal dialog. This will us and the users to create new pins, which we'll be able to display on the homepage. This is where we'll create our first GraphQL mutation and interact with our GraphQL API.

### 3. Create Pins List Page (Homepage)

Once we're able to create new pins, we can proceed by building the homepage which will display pins created by different users. Apart from doing some minor styling, here we'll also have the chance to interact with our GraphQL API. We'll need to  retrieve the list of all created pins, sorted from latest to oldest.

### 4. Create Pin Details Page

Finally, on the homepage, once a user clicks on a pin, we need to redirect her/him to the pin details page.

## Additional Notes

To create our React application, we won't be relying on any existing scaffolds. Instead, we'll simply use our existing [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) knowledge. And, as previously mentioned, we'll also use the [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) React library, which will make the whole process a bit faster.

Furthermore, for now, we won't be dealing with security and the file upload functionality. We will tackle these separately in the upcoming sections of this tutorial.
