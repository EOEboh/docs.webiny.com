- how to use the **Full Stack Application** scaffold to start building a new custom application in no time

:::info Can I use this?

In order to follow this tutorial, you must use Webiny version **5.13.0** or greater.

## Full Stack Application Scaffold

The best way to start building a new custom application would be to use the [Full Stack Application](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/full-stack-application) scaffold, which will automatically generate all of the fundamental application pieces for us. This includes the following.

### GraphQL API

A new GraphQL API created as a new [project application](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) within our Webiny project. We will use the [Extend GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/extend-admin-area/introduction) scaffold to extend it, meaning, create new GraphQL types, queries, and mutations.

This project application doesn't depend on any other project applications, meaning we can immediately deploy it once the scaffolding process has finished.

Speaking of deployment, note that we'll need to deploy the newly created GraphQL API before jumping to React application development, simply because the React application relies on it. This is also something the [Full Stack Application](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/full-stack-application) scaffold will warn us about, and will offer to do it for us.

### React Application

A new React application created as a new [project application](/docs/key-topics/project-organization/project-applications-and-packages) within our Webiny project. Here, we won't be relying on any existing scaffolds. Instead, in order to recreate the original Pinterest application's user interface, we'll simply use our existing [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) knowledge. As mentioned, we'll also use [Ant Design React library](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), which will make the whole process a bit faster.

<CenteredImage
  alt="React Application Depends on GraphQL API"
  style={{ maxWidth: 500 }}
  shadow={false}
  canEnlarge={false}
  src={dependentApps}
/>

## Running the Scaffold

So, in our terminal of choice, from our project root, let's run the following command:

```
yarn webiny scaffold
```

Running this command should give us the following list of available scaffolds:

<CenteredImage alt="Scaffolds List" style={{ maxWidth: 650 }} src={scaffoldsList} />

Once we've selected the **Full Stack Application** scaffold from the list, we'll get presented with the the following three questions:

1. the name of the new full stack application
2. the description of the new full stack application
3. the path in which the new full stack application will be created

For the name, we'll go with **Pinterest Clone**. For description and path, we'll go with the provided defaults, where the path will automatically be set to **pinterest-clone**.

Once we've answered all of the questions, after a quick confirmation step, scaffolding will start. Once the process has been completed, we'll also be asked about whether we want to include a simple GraphQL API example in the created application code. For now, we can go with **no** here.

Furthermore, we'll also be asked about whether we want to immediately deploy the newly created GraphQL API. Here, it's recommended we go with **yes**, and that's what we'll do.

Ultimately, we should end up with the following output in our terminal:

<CenteredImage
  alt="Full Stack Application - Full Output"
  style={{ maxWidth: 650 }}
  src={fullStackAppScaffold}
/>

## Using the Watch Command

Once the scaffold process has been completed, it's time to start building our application.

In order to do that effectively, we will need the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) command, which, essentially, does two things. First, it ensures that your application code is automatically built and deployed into the cloud, as you're making changes to it. Second, any changes to the cloud infrastructure code is also detected, and, likewise, will result in cloud infrastructure changes.

:::info
Note that, when it comes to frontend development, or, in our case, React application development, the command will not perform any automatic deployments. This is simply because frontend application development can still be performed locally, on the developer's machine. You only deploy the application when you need to have it online.
:::

Since the
### GraphQL API

The following command will start a new watch session on our GraphQL API application code:

```
yarn webiny watch api/code/graphql --env dev
```

A couple of notes here.

#### Watch Path

Instead of `api/code/graphql`, note that we could've also passed `api` as the first argument. But, that would initialize a watch session on the whole **API** project application, which is most probably not what we want. We only want to watch the GraphQL API application code that's deployed as part of it, located within the `api/code/graphql` path.

#### Initial Deployment

Upon initializing a new watch session, all of the application code changes that were performed during the scaffolding process will automatically be deployed into the cloud. Meaning, all of the new GraphQL query and mutation operations should be immediately visible in the remote GraphQL schema.

:::tip Misplaced GraphQL API URL?
Running the `yarn webiny info` command in your Webiny project folder will give you all of the relevant project URLs, including the URL of your GraphQL API.
:::

### Admin Area Application

The following command will start a new watch session on our Admin Area application code:

```
yarn webiny watch apps/admin --env dev
```

#### No Initial Deployment

In contrast to the [GraphQL API](/docs/tutorials/extend-admin-area/getting-started#graphql-api) development, where the application code needs to be redeployed into the cloud as we're making changes to it, Admin Area application can be developed locally. Meaning, once the watch command is run, no automatic deployments will be performed.

## Final Result

### Watch Commands

The following screenshot shows the two watch commands run side-by-side in two separate terminal sessions:

### Admin Area Application

Once the two watch sessions have been started, in our Admin Area application, we should be able to see the new **Car Manufacturers** module and, via the generated [CRUD view](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/extend-admin-area/#new-webiny-admin-area-module), perform essential CRUD operations.

:::tip
By default, the Admin Area application should be locally accessible via [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).
:::

## Further Development

Once we got the initial **Car Manufacturers** Admin Area application module working, we can proceed by modifying and extending it to our needs.

Usually, on the GraphQL API side, we'd want to start by extending the [`CarManufacturer` entity](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/extend-admin-area/api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/carManufacturers/entities/CarManufacturer.ts) and our [GraphQL schema](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/extend-admin-area/api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/carManufacturers/typeDefs.ts) with new attributes and fields, respectively. Once we're done, we'd then continue by propagating the same changes to the Admin Area application, by adding new form fields to the [`CarManufacturersForm`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/extend-admin-area/apps/admin/code/src/plugins/scaffolds/carManufacturers/views/CarManufacturersForm.tsx) React component and updating relevant [GraphQL queries and mutations](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-examples/blob/master/extend-admin-area/apps/admin/code/src/plugins/scaffolds/carManufacturers/views/hooks/graphql.ts).

## FAQ

#### Which database is used in the generated GraphQL API application code?

The generated GraphQL API application code relies exclusively on [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for storing and retrieving data. Of course, you're certainly free to [bring your own](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/extend-graphql-api#storing-and-retrieving-data) databases and import different database clients, if need be.

#### Do I need to deploy the created React application in order to continue development?

No. As mentioned above, frontend application development can still be performed locally, on the developer's machine. You only deploy the application when you need to have it online.
