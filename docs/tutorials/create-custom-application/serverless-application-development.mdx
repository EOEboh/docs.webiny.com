### Serverless Application Development

For new developers and developers who haven't had the chance to work with serverless technologies before, serverless application development can definitely be surprising and sometimes even challenging.

For example, in *traditional*, non-serverless application development, usually, developers are able to spin up the whole application locally, on their machine. This is done via virtual machines, or alternatively via [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers, which help emulate the environment in which the actual production application is running.

With these technologies, developers start different backend services, APIs, and similar, to which the locally hosted frontend app may interact with.

That being said, the main difference between *traditional* and serverless application development is that you can't really do that anymore. This is because serverless services often cannot be run on your local machine, they only exist in the cloud. Some of the examples are [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Amazons SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), and so on.

Sure, there are different utilities that try to emulate the cloud and, sort of, enable local development. But the main problem with these solutions is that they can't really keep pace with the developments happening in different clouds, and most importantly, will never be able to 100% emulate the actual service. This poses a problem because, while developing your application, it might seem everything works. But, when you deploy your application into the cloud, different issues may start to occur.

CLOUD + APPLICATION CODE DEV, NOT ONLY APP
