- how to search for articles with any category version on old entries

:::

## Example Models for This Article

In this article we will use `Article` and `Category` models where `Category` will be a single value reference field on the article.
So GraphQL query would look like:


```graphql
{
	listArticles {
		data {
			id
			entryId
			category {
				id
				entryId
			}
		}
	}
}
```


## Why Do We Need a Workaround?

Prior to *5.19.0* we did not store both ID (generated string + version) and entryId (generated string only) into the database, and you could not search for all `Articles` that have `Category` in any available version.
We changed that in *5.19.0*.

Since there are data changes that are required for search to work, and we decided not to do a migration for that, because it is too dangerous to change your data like that, you will need a workaround to search entries stored prior to *5.19.0*.

Let's say you want to search for Category with `entryId` *61a8c8a4625b0c0008fc8652* and you know that latest version is *3*, you would run a query like this:

```graphql
{
	listArticles(
		where: {
			category: {
				entryId_in: [
					"61a8c8a4625b0c0008fc8652#0001",
					"61a8c8a4625b0c0008fc8652#0002",
					"61a8c8a4625b0c0008fc8652#0003",
					"61a8c8a4625b0c0008fc8652"
				]
			}
		}
	) {
		data {
			id
			category {
				id
			}
		}
	}
}
```
In this example, exact IDs are to search entries stored prior to *5.19.0* and generated string only is to search for newly stored entries.

## What If I Do Not Want to Use Workaround?

If you do not want to use the workaround, you will need to save and publish all your already published entries.
You can either do it manually or via API calls directly.

If you want to use the API be sure to first update the entry and then publish it.

If you want to use Webiny Admin UI, you can just click *Save & Publish* button which updates and publishes the entry.
