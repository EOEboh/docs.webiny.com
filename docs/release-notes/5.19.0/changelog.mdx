# Changes



## Development

### Fixed Incorrect AWS Profile Being Logged During Deployment ([#2078](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2078))

In order to use the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) command, AWS credentials need to be set, which can be done in [multiple ways](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/aws/configure-aws-credentials).

When relying on environment variables, users can choose to either use a combination of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, or a single `AWS_PROFILE` variable. In case of the former, we've noticed that, during deployment, an incorrect message would get displayed in the terminal, saying AWS profile "undefined" is being used.

This has now been addressed. From now on, when a combination of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables is used, the AWS Access Key ID will be displayed instead.
