## Development

### Pulumi CLI Is Now Downloaded Into Project Root's `.webiny` Folder ([#1947](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1947))

To deploy necessary cloud infrastructure, by default, Webiny relies on [Pulumi](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi), a modern infrastructure as code framework.

For every Webiny project, the framework is downloaded automatically, and, prior to this release, all of the related binaries would be downloaded into project's `node_modules/@webiny/pulumi-sdk/pulumi` folder. And although this works, over time, we've noticed a couple of interesting issues with this solution:

- running the `yarn` command to reinstall project's dependencies would cause the downloaded binaries to be removed, making the user re-download the Pulumi CLI
- while in runtime, Pulumi CLI can store sensitive files in this directory, which can create different deployment and security-related issues

Because of these, from now on, all of the Pulumi CLI related binaries will be downloaded into the `.webiny/pulumi-cli` folder, located in your project root.

:::note
Once your project has been upgraded to `5.16.0`, upon running the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) or the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) command, the Pulumi CLI will be re-downloaded. This is normal and will happen even if you already had the Pulumi CLI downloaded in the mentioned `node_modules/@webiny/pulumi-sdk/pulumi` folder.

### Improved Webiny CLI ([#1946](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1946))

Webiny CLI also received a couple of neat improvements.

For starters, we've introduced the `--allow-production` flag for the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) command, which allows the user to run the command even with `prod` and `production` environments (by default, the command doesn't allow that).

Speaking of the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command) command, we've also made the logs displayed in the **Deploy** pane a bit cleaner and nicer:

<CenteredImage alt='"webiny watch" Command - The Improved Deploy Pane' src={watchDeployPaneImprovement} style={{maxWidth: 750}}/>

Finally, the [Full Stack Application](/docs/how-to-guides/scaffolding/full-stack-application/) scaffold should now work correctly on Windows operating system.
