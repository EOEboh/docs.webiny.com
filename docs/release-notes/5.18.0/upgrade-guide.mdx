- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.17.0 to 5.18.0

:::

:::danger
Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#-precaution-measures) section.
:::

:::info
Make sure to check out the [5.18.0 changelog](/docs/release-notes/5.18.0/changelog) to get familiar with all the changes introduced in this release.

## 1. Project Preparation

First, we need to prepare your project for the upgrade process. With security packages refactor, some packages no longer exist, and if we try to upgrade dependencies straight away, `yarn` will complain. To fix that, we need to clean up your project first, to eliminate references to those deprecated packages.

In your project root, run the following:

```bash
npx https://gist.github.com/Pavel910/00845bb90c1d5299ccc882f2ef172996
```

## 2. Upgrade Webiny Packages

We're now ready to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages! Run the following command:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.18.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.18.0`.

:::info
Before moving on, make sure you commit all your changes.
:::

## 3. Run the Upgrade Command

Now let's run the project upgrade:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade
```

The upgrade script will make a couple of changes to your existing **API** project application's code (located within the `api` folder) and several changes to your **Admin Area** project application. Once the upgrade command has finished, you can run the [`git status`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-status) command to see all changes that the command performed.

Before moving on to the next step, review the changes in your IDE, and remove the backup files created by the upgrade script.

## 4. Deploy Your Project

Finally, proceed by re-deploying your Webiny project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy --env {environment}
```

:::caution
As stated in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny#pre-production-environments-first) section, we recommend that you first deploy your changes into one of your pre-production environments, like `dev` or `staging`.
