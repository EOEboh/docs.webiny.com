The highlight of this release - the new [Amazon DynamoDB]-only version of Webiny Serverless CMS!

As the name itself suggests, this new setup completely relies on [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) for storing and retrieving data!

With the [Amazon ElasticSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/the-elk-stack/what-is-elasticsearch/) no longer being a requirement, developers and organizations working on smaller and medium-sized projects can benefit from the following:

- faster to get started
- easier custom development
- less maintenance
- 100% serverless
- cheaper - there are no fixed monthly costs, you only pay for what you use

We also believe this new setup will make things a bit easier for developers who want to contribute to the project, which is something we've been passionate about from the very beginning of Webiny!

To try the new DynamoDB-only version of Webiny, simply run the following command in your terminal of choice, and follow the on-screen instructions:

```bash
npx create-webiny-project my-webiny-projects
```

We really hope you'll give this new version of Webiny Serverless CMS a try and that you'll love it. For any questions, suggestions, or general feedback, feel free to message us on our [community Slack channel](https://www.webiny.com/slack), we'd certainly love to hear from you!


## Development

### Overhaul of Existing Development Tools

A complete overhaul was done on the most important development-related Webiny CLI commands - [`webiny deploy`](#) and [`webiny watch`](#). In short, you can expect both of these to be faster and also consume lot less system resources.

In case you would like to learn more, feel free to check out the links to closed pull requests.

### Pulumi Command - --json flag



### Watch Command - Changed `--logs` Flag

## Headless CMS

### A New Way To Hook Into Install, Group, Model or Entry Lifecycle

We removed existing `InstallationPlugin`, `CmsContentModelHookPlugin` and `CmsContentEntryHookPlugin` support in favor of publish/subscribe pattern. Groups did not have lifecycle support, so we added those.

To find out more about lifecycle events please read our [Lifecycle Events](/docs/key-topics/headless-cms/lifecycle-events) article.

### We Renamed a Lot of Plugins, Types and Interfaces

The team agreed on some new namings and, to accommodate that, we removed the `Content` word from all types, interfaces and classes.
Names for some interfaces were changed a bit as well, for example, `ContentModelGroup` is now `CmsGroup`.

There are probably a hundred or so types, interfaces and classes changed so listing them all would produce an unreadable piece of text, but here are the most important ones:

- ContentModelPlugin -> CmsModelPlugin
- ContentModelGroupPlugin -> CmsGroupPlugin
- CmsModelFieldToStoragePlugin -> StorageTransformPlugin - and it is a class now

:::note
If you used some of renamed types, interfaces and classes your build/deploy will break, so just change them.

## Page Builder

### Button Page Element - Ability to Register A Custom Callback Handler ([#2022](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2022))

## Documentation

### Reorganization of Existing Documentation Articles ([#347](https://github.com/webiny/docs.webiny.com/pull/347))

Based on the feedback we've been getting from our users, we've decided to reorganize our documentation portal.

Some of the changes are:

-

- articles are organized in a way that's more logica

### Create Custom Application - Security Tutorial ([#340](https://github.com/webiny/docs.webiny.com/pull/340))

We've expanded our existing [Create Custom Application](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/introduction) tutorial with the new [Security](#) section!

As the title suggests, in this section we dive deeper into the security aspect of custom application development. We cover implementation of different concepts like authentication, authorization, deploying custom cloud infrastructure resources, [Amazon Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html), and more!

If you're interested in learning more about (serverless) custom application development with Webiny, then we definitely encourage you to check this out.
