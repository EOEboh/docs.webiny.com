## DynamoDB-only Version of Webiny Serverless CMS [WIP]

The highlight of this release - the new DynamoDB-only version of Webiny!

As the name itself suggests, this new setup completely relies on DynamoDB for storing and retrieving data, making it 100% serverless! You no longer need to have Amazon ElasticSearch in the mix!

This is especially important for smaller to medium-sized projects and also Webiny contributors.

## Development

### Overhaul of Existing Development Tools

Write this.

### Watch Command - Changed `--logs` Flag

Write this.

## Headless CMS

### A New Way To Hook Into Group, Model or Entry Lifecycle

We removed existing `InstallationPlugin`, `CmsContentModelHookPlugin` and `CmsContentEntryHookPlugin` support in favor of publish/subscribe pattern. Groups did not have lifecycle support, so we added those.

To find out more about lifecycle events please read our [Lifecycle Events](/docs/key-topics/headless-cms/lifecycle-events) article.

### We Renamed a Lot of Plugins, Types and Interfaces

The team agreed on some new namings and to accommodate that we removed the `Content` word from all types, interfaces and classes.
Names for some interfaces were changed a bit as well, for example, `ContentModelGroup` is now `CmsGroup`.

There are probably a hundred or so types, interfaces and classes changed so listing them all would produce a non-readable piece of text, but here are the most important ones:
* ContentModelPlugin -> CmsModelPlugin
* ContentModelGroupPlugin -> CmsGroupPlugin
* CmsModelFieldToStoragePlugin -> StorageTransformPlugin - and it is a class now

:::note
If you used some of renamed types, interfaces and classes your build/deploy will break, so just change them.

## Documentation

### Reorganization of Existing Documentation Articles ([#347](https://github.com/webiny/docs.webiny.com/pull/347))

### Create Custom Application - Security Tutorial ([#340](https://github.com/webiny/docs.webiny.com/pull/340))

We've expanded our existing [Create Custom Application](/docs/tutorials/create-custom-application/introduction) tutorial with the new [Security](#) section!

As the title suggests, in this section we dive deeper into the security aspect of custom application development. We cover implementation of different concepts like authentication, authorization, deploying custom cloud infrastructure resources, [Amazon Cognito User Pools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-identity-pools.html), and more!

If you're interested in learning more about (serverless) custom application development with Webiny, then we definitely encourage you to check this out.
