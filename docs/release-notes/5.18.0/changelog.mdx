## Headless CMS

### A New Way To Hook Into Group, Model or Entry Lifecycle

We removed existing `CmsContentModelHookPlugin` and `CmsContentEntryHookPlugin` support in favor of publish/subscribe pattern. Groups did not have lifecycle support, so we added those.

To find out more about lifecycle events please read our [Lifecycle Events](/docs/key-topics/headless-cms/lifecycle-events) article.


### We Renamed a Lot of Plugins, Types and Interfaces

The team agreed on some new namings and to accommodate that we removed Content from all types, interfaces and classes.
Names for some interfaces were changed a bit as well, for example, `ContentModelGroup` is now `CmsGroup`.

If you have created a Model or a Group via plugins, they are renamed as well.
`ContentModelPlugin` is now `CmsModelPlugin` and `ContentModelGroupPlugin` is `CmsGroupPlugin` - file names were changed as well.

There are probably a hundred or so types, interfaces and classes changed so listing them all would produce a non-readable piece of text.

:::note
If you used some of renamed types, interfaces and classes your build/deploy will break, so just change them.
