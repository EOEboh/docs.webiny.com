## Headless CMS

### A New Way To Hook Into Group, Model or Entry Lifecycle

We removed existing `CmsContentModelHookPlugin` and `CmsContentEntryHookPlugin` support in favor of publish/subscribe pattern. Groups did not have lifecycle support, so we added those.

To find out more about lifecycle events please read our [Lifecycle Events](/docs/key-topics/headless-cms/lifecycle-events) article.


### We Renamed a So Plugins, Types and Interfaces

The team agreed on some new namings and to accommodate that we removed Content from all types, interfaces and classes.
Names for some interfaces were changed a bit as well, for example, `ContentModelGroup` is now `CmsGroup`.

There are probably a hundred or so types, interfaces and classes changed so listing them all would produce a non-readable piece of text, but here are the most important ones:
* ContentModelPlugin -> CmsModelPlugin
* ContentModelGroupPlugin -> CmsGroupPlugin
* CmsModelFieldToStoragePlugin -> StorageTransformPlugin - and it is a class now

:::note
If you used some of renamed types, interfaces and classes your build/deploy will break, so just change them.
