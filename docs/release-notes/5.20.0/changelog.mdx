# Changes

## Headless CMS

### Clone CMS Model ([#2131](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2131)) ([#2132](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2132))

User has the ability to clone existing model into same or another locale.

### Programmatically Created Content Models - Fixed "List-Entries" GraphQL Query  ([#2133](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2133))

We've resolved an issue that would occur when a user created a content model programmatically (via the [`CmsModelPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/api-headless-cms/src/content/plugins/CmsModelPlugin.ts#L9) plugin), and then tried to issue its respective GraphQL query that lists all entries. This issue was occurring only on the DynamoDB + Elasticsearch setup of Webiny.

:::info
To learn more about creating content models via plugins, check out the [Define Content Models via Plugins](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-applications/headless-cms/content-model-plugins/) guide.

### Fixed Marking a Nested Object's Field as Title Field ([#2127](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2127))

Bug manifested only in the Admin Area when the nested object field had the same `fieldId` as model `titleFieldId`.

### Fixed an Admin Area Bug Where Date Field Value Was Set as Null ([#2126](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2126))

Bug manifested when user was creating new entry with any of the `date` type fields and did not change the default value in the Admin Area.

### Fixed an API Search Bug ([#2125](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2125))

Bug manifested when user was searching for entry with either `id` or `entryId` parameter.

### Fixed an API Bug Where Schema Was Breaking ([#2120](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2120))

Bug manifested when user added an empty nested object field as first field in the model.

## Page Builder

### Added Ability to Re-render an Existing Published Page ([#2092](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2092))

From time to time, users may need to re-render a particular page they've previously created and published. This can now be done easily via the built-in [API Playground](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-applications/admin-area/api-playground/), by executing a simple `rerenderPage` GraphQL mutation. For example:

```graphql title='Re-rendering a Page via the "rerenderPage" Mutation'
mutation {
  pageBuilder {
    rerenderPage(id: "xyz") {
        data {
            id
            path
        }
    }
  }
}
```

### Replaced Lifecycle Hooks With Publish And Subscribe Methods ([#2136](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2136))

We removed `PagePlugin` hooks in favor of publish / subscribe methods. To find out which methods exist read the [article](/docs/key-topics/page-builder/lifecycle-events) about them.

:::warning
If you have used `PagePlugin` hooks, please switch to the subscribe methods, because hooks were completely removed.

## Development

### Fixed `webiny watch` Command's `--remoteRuntimeLogs` (`-r`) Argument ([#2124](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2124))

In a couple of scenarios, upon running the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command/) command, adding the `--remoteRuntimeLogs` (`-r`) argument would not properly return runtime logs in user's terminal. This has now been addressed.

### Fixed React Component Scaffold's `webiny.config.ts` File ([#2123](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2123))

The [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-react-component/template/webiny.config.ts) file that is generated when running the React Component scaffold has been updated. It now reflects the changes done in the recent [5.18.0](/docs/release-notes/5.18.0/changelog) release.

### Two New `webiny deploy` Hooks ([#2079](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2079))

You can now hook onto the pre-build and post-build events that are emitted during the `webiny deploy` command. More information about all related hooks can be found in

## Documentation

### Updated All Mentions of `webiny.config.ts` Files ([#366](https://github.com/webiny/docs.webiny.com/pull/366))
