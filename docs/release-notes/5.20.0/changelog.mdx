## Headless CMS

### Fixed Failing List Query When Querying a Model That Was Created via Plugin ([#2133](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2133))

### Fixed an API Bug Where Both `id` And `entryId` Search Returned Same Records In Listing ([#2125](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2125))

### Fixed an API Bug Where Schema Was Breaking If First Field In Model Was An Empty Object Field ([#2120](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2120))
