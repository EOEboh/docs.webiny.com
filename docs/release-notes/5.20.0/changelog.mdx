# Changes

## Headless CMS

##### Fixed Failing List Query ([#2133](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2133))

This bug occurred when user created a model via the CmsModelPlugin class, and there were no entries inserted. DynamoDB + Elasticsearch was only affected.

##### Clone CMS Model ([#2131](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2131)) ([#2132](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2132))

##### Fixed Marking a Nested Object's Field as Title Field ([#2127](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2127))

##### Fixed an Admin Area Bug Where Date Field Value Was Set as Null ([#2126](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2126))

##### Fixed an API Search Bug ([#2125](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2125))

##### Fixed an API Bug Where Schema Was Breaking ([#2120](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2120))

## Page Builder

### Added Ability to Re-render an Existing Published Page ([#2092](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2092))

From time to time, users may need to re-render a particular page they've previously created and published. This can now be done easily via the built-in [API Playground](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-applications/admin-area/api-playground/), by executing a simple `rerenderPage` GraphQL mutation. For example:

```graphql title='Re-rendering a Page via the "rerenderPage" Mutation'
mutation {
  pageBuilder {
    rerenderPage(id: "xyz") {
        data {
            id
            path
        }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

### Fixed `webiny watch` Command's `--remoteRuntimeLogs` (`-r`) Argument ([#2124](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2124))

In a couple of scenarios, upon running the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command/) command, adding the `--remoteRuntimeLogs` (`-r`) argument would not properly return runtime logs in user's terminal. This has now been addressed.

### Fixed React Component Scaffold's `webiny.config.ts` File ([#2123](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2123))

The [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-react-component/template/webiny.config.ts) file that is generated when running the React Component scaffold has been updated. It now reflects the changes done in the recent [5.18.0](/docs/release-notes/5.18.0/changelog) release.

### Two New `webiny deploy` Hooks ([#2079](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2079))

You can now hook onto the pre-build and post-build events that are emitted during the `webiny deploy` command. More information about all related hooks can be found in

## Documentation

### Updated All Mentions of `webiny.config.ts` Files ([#366](https://github.com/webiny/docs.webiny.com/pull/366))
