# Changes

## Headless CMS

### Introducing the Ability to Clone Existing Content Models ([#2131](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2131)) ([#2132](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2132))

With this new feature, users now have the ability to clone existing content models into the same or a different locale. No more manual re-creation of the same content model in a different locale!

### Programmatically Created Content Models - Fixed "List-Entries" GraphQL Query ([#2133](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2133))

We've resolved an issue that would occur when a user created a content model programmatically (via the [`CmsModelPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/api-headless-cms/src/content/plugins/CmsModelPlugin.ts#L9) plugin), and then tried to issue its respective GraphQL query that lists all entries. This issue was occurring only on the DynamoDB + Elasticsearch setup of Webiny.

### Fixed Marking a Nested Object's Field as Title Field ([#2127](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2127))

Bug manifested only in the Admin Area when the nested object field had the same `fieldId` as model `titleFieldId`.

### Fixed an Admin Area Bug Where Date Field Value Was Set as Null ([#2126](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2126))

Bug manifested when user was creating new entry with any of the `date` type fields and did not change the default value in the Admin Area.

### Fixed an API Search Bug ([#2125](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2125))

Bug manifested when user was searching for entry with either `id` or `entryId` parameter.

### Fixed an API Bug Where Schema Was Breaking ([#2120](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2120))

Bug manifested when user added an empty nested object field as first field in the model.

## Page Builder

### Added Ability to Re-render an Existing Published Page ([#2092](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2092))

From time to time, users may need to re-render a particular page they've previously created and published. This can now be done easily via the built-in [API Playground](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-applications/admin-area/api-playground/), by executing a simple `rerenderPage` GraphQL mutation. For example:

```graphql title='Re-rendering a Page via the "rerenderPage" Mutation'
mutation {
  pageBuilder {
    rerenderPage(id: "xyz") {
      data {
        id
        path
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Replaced Lifecycle Hooks With Publish And Subscribe Methods ([#2136](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2136))

In order to provide a more unified developer experience, within your GraphQL API, hooking onto Page Builderâ€™s key lifecycle events is now done via a simple [`ContextPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/handler/src/plugins/ContextPlugin.ts). No need to import a separate plugin to achieve this.

The following is a simple example that shows how you can hook onto the `onBeforeMenuUpdate` lifecycle event:

```ts
import { Context } from "~/types";

new ContextPlugin<Context>(context => {
  context.pageBuilder.onBeforeMenuUpdate.subscribe(async ({ menu, original }) => {
    // Do something here.
  });
});
```

For more details on all of the available events, please see the dedicated [Lifecycle Events](/docs/key-topics/page-builder/lifecycle-events) guide.

:::danger
The old `PagePlugin` plugins no longer work. If you've already used them in your project, please replace them with the new `PageBuilder` plugin.

## Development

### Fixed `webiny watch` Command's `--remoteRuntimeLogs` (`-r`) Argument ([#2124](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2124))

In a couple of scenarios, upon running the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/use-watch-command/) command, adding the `--remoteRuntimeLogs` (`-r`) argument would not properly return runtime logs in user's terminal. This has now been addressed.

### Fixed React Component Scaffold's `webiny.config.ts` File ([#2123](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2123))

The [`webiny.config.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-react-component/template/webiny.config.ts) file that is generated when running the React Component scaffold has been updated. It now reflects the changes done in the recent [5.18.0](/docs/release-notes/5.18.0/changelog) release.

### Two New `webiny deploy` Hooks ([#2079](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2079))

You can now hook onto the pre-build and post-build events that are emitted during the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project/) command. More information about all related hooks can be found in the new [Build and Deploy Hooks](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/build-and-deploy-hooks) guide.

## Documentation

### Updated All Mentions of `webiny.config.ts` Files ([#366](https://github.com/webiny/docs.webiny.com/pull/366))

All occurrences of `webiny.config.ts` configuration files have been updated to reflect the changes done in the recent [5.18.0](/docs/release-notes/5.18.0/changelog) release.
