## Page Builder

### Storage operations [#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872)

We extracted existing DynamoDB + Elasticsearch storage logic into [@webiny/api-page-builder-so-ddb-es](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-page-builder-so-ddb-es) package.
This allows us to create package that stores the data into DynamoDB only, or some other database.

## Elasticsearch [#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872)

### Query modifier plugin [#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872)
Due to changes in the way of how query building for Elasticsearch works we changed `ElasticsearchQueryModifierPlugin` in the [@webiny/api-elasticsearch](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/next/packages/api-elasticsearch) package.
It is an abstract class now, so if you used it to modify the query, please change it to either `PageElasticsearchQueryModifierPlugin` for `@webiny/api-page-builder` or `FileElasticsearchQueryModifierPlugin` for `@webiny/api-file-manager`. Also, in that abstract class, method named `apply` was renamed to `modifyQuery`.

### Body and sort modifier plugins [#1872](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/1872)

There are new `ElasticsearchBodyModifierPlugin` and `ElasticsearchSortModifierPlugin` abstract classes, which are extended in each of the application that uses Elasticsearch. As their name suggests, they are specialized to modify either body or sort parameters of the Elasticsearch query.

For Page Builder check out `PageElasticsearchBodyModifierPlugin` and `PageElasticsearchSortModifierPlugin` classes.

For File Manager check out  `FileElasticsearchBodyModifierPlugin` and `FileElasticsearchSortModifierPlugin` classes.
