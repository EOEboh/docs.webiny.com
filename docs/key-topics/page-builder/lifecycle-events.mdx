- how to subscribe to a lifecycle event

:::info
Lifecycle events using publish/subscribe pattern replace the PagePlugin hooks starting from version 5.20.0.
:::

## Overview

In our Page Builder we provide lifecycle events available for you to hook into.
Lifecycle events are triggered before (`onBefore` keyword) and after (`onAfter` keyword) the data is stored into the database.

With `onBefore` events you can change the data that is being stored into the database, so be careful with that.

With the lifecycle events you can hook into a number of different operations, for example:
 * change the page data which is going to be stored
 * notify another system that new page was stored

## Available Options
### System
 * onBeforeSystemInstall
 * onAfterSystemInstall

### Settings
 * onBeforeSettingsUpdate
 * onAfterSettingsUpdate

### Categories
 * onBeforeCategoryCreate
 * onAfterCategoryCreate
 * onBeforeCategoryUpdate
 * onAfterCategoryUpdate
 * onBeforeCategoryDelete
 * onAfterCategoryDelete

### Menus
 * onBeforeMenuCreate
 * onAfterMenuCreate
 * onBeforeMenuUpdate
 * onAfterMenuUpdate
 * onBeforeMenuDelete
 * onAfterMenuDelete

### Page Elements
 * onBeforePageElementCreate
 * onAfterPageElementCreate
 * onBeforePageElementUpdate
 * onAfterPageElementUpdate
 * onBeforePageElementDelete
 * onAfterPageElementDelete

### Pages
 * onBeforePageCreate
 * onAfterPageCreate
 * onBeforePageCreateFrom
 * onAfterPageCreateFrom
 * onBeforePageUpdate
 * onAfterPageUpdate
 * onBeforePageDelete
 * onAfterPageDelete
 * onBeforePagePublish
 * onAfterPagePublish
 * onBeforePageUnpublish
 * onAfterPageUnpublish
 * onBeforePageRequestChanges
 * onAfterPageRequestChanges
 * onBeforePageRequestReview
 * onAfterPageRequestReview

All the parameters for the events are typed, so it is easy to find out what data is the subscription function receiving.

## Example

It is quite easy to subscribe to some lifecycle event. Let us show you few examples:

### Change what is stored into the database
```typescript
import { PbContext } from "@webiny/api-page-builder/types";
import { ContextPlugin } from "@webiny/handler/plugins/ContextPlugin";

const changePageBeforeStoring = new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async context => {
    context.pageBuilder.onBeforePageCreate.subscribe(async(params) => {
        const {
            /**
             * The page that was stored into the database.
             */
            page
        } = params;
		/**
		 * Let's say we want to lock the page for editing if it starts with "Webiny" word in the title.
		 */
        if (page.title.match(/^Webiny/) === null) {
            return;
        }

        page.locked = true;
    });
});

/**
 * Register the plugin to the createHandler plugins array.
 */
const handler = createHandler({
	plugins: [
	    // ...
		changePageBeforeStoring,
		// ...
	]
});
```

:::danger
Please, be aware that you can change what ever you want on the page object, so be careful with that.
:::

### Notify another system that a page was stored
```typescript
import { PbContext } from "@webiny/api-page-builder/types";
import { ContextPlugin } from "@webiny/handler/plugins/ContextPlugin";

const notifyDifferentSystemWhenPageIsCreated = new ContextPlugin<PbContext>(async context => {
    context.pageBuilder.onAfterPageCreate.subscribe(async(params) => {
        const {
            /**
             * The page that was stored into the database.
             */
            page
        } = params;

        await storeItToAnotherSystem(page);
    });
});

/**
 * Register the plugin to the createHandler plugins array.
 */
const handler = createHandler({
	plugins: [
	    // ...
		notifyDifferentSystemWhenPageIsCreated,
		// ...
	]
});
```
This example will trigger a notification function (your custom function) after the Page was created successfully.

:::warning
Please, be aware that the order of subscribing matters, so if you want some event subscription to be executed before some other one, add it first.
