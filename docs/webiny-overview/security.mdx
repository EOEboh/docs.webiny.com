- how we approach app security

## App Security
Webiny is built to support different authentication mechanisms. Out of the box, it is configured to work with [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), an enterprise grade, battle tested identity provider. The framework, however, supports any identity provider, by means of plugins. 

Webiny draws a very clear line between **authentication** and **authorization**. We rely on third party IdPs for authentication, and use a very flexible system of permissions for authorization. 

Authorization is usually very closely tied to business logic, so using scopes from the JWT, or simple string-based roles, is not enough for complex business applications. To allow different types of integration, we provide a very thin security framework, based on plugins. On top of that we define permissions as rich objects with different application-related properties.


## FAQ

#### Can I use a different identity provider?
Yes, absolutely. The default IdP implementation contains as a set of plugins on API and React side. All you need to do is follow the same principle and implement your own plugins that will work with the IdP of your choice. 

#### Can I roll my own authentication system instead of using a third party IdP?
We don't recommend it, but yes, you can. Following the same implementation strategy that comes with Webiny by default, you can create all kinds of authentication mechanisms.
