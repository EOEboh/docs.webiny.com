:::tip What you'll learn

- main features of the **New React Application** scaffold
- how to continue developing on top of the generated application code

:::

## Overview

The **New React Application** scaffold extends your project's GraphQL HTTP API with a new [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) query and mutation operations.

Note that, when we say GraphQL HTTP API, by default, we're referring to the one deployed as part of the **API** project application, located within the [`api/code/graphql`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.10.0/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql) folder.

:::info
Learn more about the **API** project application on the cloud infrastructure level in the [Cloud Infrastructure](/docs/key-topics/cloud-infrastructure/api/introduction) key topics section.
:::

## Features

### Clean Setup

Except for the base application and cloud infrastructure code, the created GraphQL API does not contain any additional code or specific business logic. You can start building on top of the created code in any way you prefer. You can also bring needed libraries, introduce new cloud infrastructure resources, and more.

### Simple Cloud Infrastructure

Only a couple of cloud infrastructure resources need to be deployed in order to host a new GraphQL API, which is depicted with the following diagram:

## Development

### Essential Files

The following are the most essential files and folders that are generated in the scaffolding process.

:::info
By default, all of the files are generated in a new folder, located at `api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/{dataModelName}`, for example `api/code/graphql/src/plugins/scaffolds/carManufacturers`.
:::

[`index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/index.ts)

This is the entry file, which exports the [`GraphQLSchemaPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/handler-graphql/src/plugins/GraphQLSchemaPlugin.ts) plugin responsible for extending the existing GraphQL API schema, using new [type definitions](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/index.ts#L13) and supporting [resolvers](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/index.ts#L14-L25).

[`typeDefs.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/typeDefs.ts)

A file that contains the schema with which we are extending our GraphQL API. This will usually be the starting point if you want to make further changes to the generated code, for example add new fields to the initial data model, add new GraphQL query or mutation operations, and more.

Note that in the case of the latter, you also need to define a standalone resolver function that is responsible for handling newly added query or mutation operation.

[`resolvers/`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.10.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/resolvers)

This folder contains the GraphQL resolver classes that support the generated [query](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/resolvers/TargetDataModelsQuery.ts) and [mutation](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/resolvers/TargetDataModelsMutation.ts) GraphQL operations.

These will need to be updated as you make changes in the mentioned [`typeDefs.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/typeDefs.ts) file. For example, if you were to introduce a new `listPopularCarManufacturers` GraphQL query, the same `listPopularCarManufacturers` method would need to be defined within the [`CarManufacturersQuery`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/resolvers/TargetDataModelsQuery.ts) class.

[`entities/`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.10.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/entities)

Contains [DynamoDB Toolbox](https://github.com/jeremydaly/dynamodb-toolbox) entities, which are used within GraphQL resolver functions. You are free to add additional entities, or modify the existing one (for example - add new entity attributes).

[`__tests__/`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.10.0/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__)

Contains tests that ensure your application code is working as expected. As mentioned, three tests are included by default: one unit, one integration, and one end-to-end (E2E) test.

### First Deploy

Once you've completed the scaffold's wizard and the files have been generated, in order to actually see the changes made to your GraphQL API, you need to deploy them. This can be done as usual via the [`webiny deploy`](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) command, or, even easier, if you're about to jump straight into coding, by running the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/use-watch-command) command. This command will not only deploy the changes, but also start a new watch session, which will automatically redeploy further application code changes, as you perform them. More on this below.

### Development Using the Watch Command

The most straightforward way to further develop on top of the generated code would be via the [`webiny watch`](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/use-watch-command) command.

In order to get started, from your project root, simply run the following command:

```
yarn webiny watch api/code/graphql --env {env}
```

With the new watch session initialized, every change you make in the code will automatically trigger a re-deploy of the code, enabling you to see the changes in the cloud almost immediately as you make them (every redeployment takes 2-4 seconds to complete).

And although developers often choose this approach when developing smaller features or proof of concepts, for anything larger in scope, we recommend the new code to be tested via one or more of the mentioned types of tests.

### Writing and Running Tests

As mentioned in the [Features](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/extend-graphql-api#features) section, by default, the scaffold includes three tests: one unit, one integration, and one end-to-end (E2E) test. When generated, all three tests should be passing once you run them, but do note that in order for the integration and end-to-end (E2E) tests to pass, you have to have your **API** project application already deployed, preferably into a development environment, for example `dev`.

:::info
To run the tests, Webiny relies on [Jest](/docs/key-topics/tools-libraries#testing), a JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity.

#### Initial Test Files

#### [`typeDefs.unit.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/typeDefs.unit.test.ts)

A simple unit test which simply ensures that the base GraphQL type exists. Might not be a super useful example, but still, this test is here more for awareness purposes (so that developers know these can be added too).

#### [`crud.integration.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/crud.integration.test.ts)

An integration test which ensures essential CRUD GraphQL query and mutation operations are working as expected. These tests are run against the application code that you have locally, but note that the code is still interacting with real cloud infrastructure resources.

#### [`crud.e2e.test.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5/packages/cli-plugin-scaffold-graphql-service/template/__tests__/crud.e2e.test.ts)

An end-to-end (E2E) test which ensures essential CRUD GraphQL query and mutation operations are working as expected.

Note that, although it may seem this test is testing the same functionality we've tested with the integration test, this test is run against the application code that's deployed into the actual cloud, by issuing HTTP requests to the deployed Cloudfront distribution, behind which our AWS Lambda function resides. In other words, this test makes sure not only our code is working as expected, but also that the cloud infrastructure resources are deployed and configured properly.

#### Running Tests

All of the test-running scripts can already be found in your root [package.json](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/next/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/dependencies.json#L68-L71) file.

In order to run all tests, use the `yarn test` command. Additionally, to only run tests of a specific type, use the `yarn test:unit`, `yarn test:integration`, and `yarn test:e2e` commands.

:::tip
Jest supports the [`--watch`](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#--watch) argument, which enables us to continuously re-run tests as we're making changes to them. You can use it with the above-shown commands.

#### Creating New Tests

You are free to create new tests in the similar fashion, or amend the existing one.

## FAQ

#### How does security (authentication and authorization) work?

Please note that, by default, the authentication and authorization logic isn't included in the generated code. In other words, all of the generated GraphQL query and mutation operations can be performed by anonymous (not logged-in) users, which is in most cases not the desired behaviour.

Luckily, with a couple of built-in utilities, this can be relatively easily added. Please check out the [existing tutorials](/docs/tutorials/extend-admin-area/security/introduction) to learn how to implement these on your own.

#### I need more flexibility when it comes to data querying. Can I bring in a different database, for example ElasticSearch?

Yes, you can. You can actually utilize the already deployed ElasticSearch cluster that's deployed with every Webiny project, by default.

Until we create a dedicated tutorial on the topic, feel free to ping us via our community [Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack).

#### Can Webiny's multi-tenancy feature be utilized with this scaffold?

Yes, but do note that since multi-tenancy is part of Webiny's enterprise offering, the relevant multi-tenancy code is not included in the generated application code.

For more information on multi-tenancy, we recommend you check out the [Multi-Tenancy](/docs/key-topics/multi-tenancy) key topic. Also, for any implementation-related questions, feel free to contact us directly via our community [Slack](https://www.webiny.com/slack).
