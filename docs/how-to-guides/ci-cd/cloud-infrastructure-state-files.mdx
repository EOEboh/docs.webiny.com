## Cloud Infrastructure State Files

In order to bring your project into existence, you need to deploy your application code, along with the necessary cloud infrastructure, into a cloud provider of your choice, for example [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

By default, for everything deployment-related, Webiny relies on Pulumi, a modern infrastructure as code (IaC) framework, which, essentially, enables us to define needed cloud infrastructure via code, and ultimately, deploy it into one or more separate environments.

:::info
Read more about Pulumi, environments, and other concepts in our [Deployment](/docs/key-topics/deployment/introduction) key topics section.

One of the fundamental concept of almost all IaC frameworks are cloud infrastructure state files. Every framework handles them differently, but in all cases, state files describe the state of your cloud infrastructure. Things like which cloud infrastructure resources are currently deployed, which configuration params were used upon deploying them, and more, are just some of the information the state files contain.

It's important to know that state files must not be lost or deleted, because otherwise, the connection between our IaC framework (Pulumi) and the actual cloud infrastructure resources would be lost. Meaning, we would lost the ability to update existing cloud infrastructure resources or even delete them (using the IaC framework).

:::info
In case of the latter, if we wanted to delete all of the previously deployed resources, we would have to do it manually, via the cloud provider's user interface or using a CLI.

## Managing Cloud Infrastructure State Files

Because of the fact that our cloud infrastructure state files must be preserved at all cost, we are often talking about **cloud infrastructure state management**, or, in context of IaC frameworks and cloud infrastructure deployments, just **state management**.

The Pulumi framework offers a couple of convenient solutions, called [backends](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/#state-and-backends), that solve the management overhead for us. In the following section, we briefly cover the most often used backends, and after that, the best practices around how to utilize them.

### Local File System

This is the default way of storing state files. After you deploy your Webiny project for the first time, you can notice the `.pulumi` files being generated inside of your `api`, `apps/admin`, and `apps/website` project applications folders.

The following directory tree shows how the `.pulumi` folders are generated in your Webiny project:
```
