- how to use the built-in scaffold to set up your CI/CD in no time

:::

## Overview

In order to set up your own CI/CD workflow faster (with all of the concepts, steps, and strategies explained in previous guides), we recommend you use the built-in CI/CD scaffold.

To use it, simply run the following command from your project root:

```bash
yarn webiny scaffold
```

Once the list of all available scaffolds has been shown, select the **Set up CI/CD** option and continue by answering the questions that will follow.

## Different CI/CD Providers

At the moment, the scaffold allows you to set up your CI/CD only with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), but we would certainly like to also bring support for more providers, depending on the interest from the community.

:::tip
If you plan to use a different CI/CD provider, you can still create your workflows manually, by following all of the recommendations outlined in previous guides. Also, if you think your provider should be supported out of the box, please [open an issue](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/issues) or [contact us](https://www.webiny.com/slack).
