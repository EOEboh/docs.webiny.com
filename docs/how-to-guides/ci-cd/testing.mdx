## Application Testing - A Brief Overview

One of the fundamental parts of every CI/CD workflow are tests, which essentially, help us ensure that our application is working the way it's supposed to.

"Does the login system work?", "Is the price calculated correctly?", or "Is a particular page rendered correctly?", are just some of the examples of parts of our application that we can inspect every time our tests are run.

### Different Types of Tests

There are three fundamental types of tests we usually write while developing our application: unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E). Let's briefly cover each type.

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests are the smallest when it comes to scope, and, as the name itself suggests, are created to ensure a small unit of our application is working as expected. For example, we might test whether a particular function, given a specific set of arguments, returns the correct result.

The code we're testing here does not interact with other moving parts in your application or external services, like for example a database.

Typically, unit tests are the fastest to run.

#### Integration Tests

As soon as the code we're testing interacts with other moving parts or external services, like for example a database, we're talking about integration tests.

Typically, because external services need to be deployed, running these is slower than running unit tests. But, they can provide more confidence that our application is working, simply because of a much greater coverage than what unit tests provide.

#### End-to-end (E2E) Tests

Finally, the end-to-end (E2E) tests the whole application, using it as an actual user would do it. Some examples are testing a GraphQL API or when talking about frontend development, simulating a user completing a signup form.

Running these tests is slower than both integration and unit tests, but they can provide the best result when it comes to ensuring that our application is working as expected. Simulating a user completing a user signup flow not only ensures our user interface is working as it should be, but also the backend HTTP API, with which the form is interacting.

## FAQ

#### Should I use different Amazon S3 buckets for different shared long-lived environments?

If you're using a separate cloud (AWS) account for every long-lived environment, then the answer is yes and this is the approach we recommend you adapt.
