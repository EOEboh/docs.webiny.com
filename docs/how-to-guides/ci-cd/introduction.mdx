## Overview

The process of application development is much more than just writing application code. It entails several different subprocesses, which are equally, if not more, important. For example:

- testing
- deployment into multiple environments
- organizing code in multiple VCS branches
- choosing the right cloud infrastructure resources for the job
- storing and managing cloud infrastructure state files
- security
- monitoring and observability <!-- (https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-vs-observability-whats-the-difference/) -->
- team organization

In the following sections, we cover some of these subprocesses and provide best practices around how to structure and implement them, within your CI/CD workflow.
