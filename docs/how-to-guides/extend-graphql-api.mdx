## Introduction

When it comes to HTTP API development, Webiny relies on [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). In fact, all of the applications that are part of the Webiny Serverless CMS, for example [Page Builder](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/page-builder) or [Headless CMS](https://www.webiny.com/serverless-app/headless-cms), are using it in order to enable developers programmatic interaction via a client of their choice, for example a browser.

By default, every Webiny project starts off with two separate GraphQL APIs.

### Default GraphQL API

The **default GraphQL API** (or just **GraphQL API**) is the GraphQL API that's located within the [`api/code/graphql`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql) folder. All of the Webiny Serverless CMS applications are built on top of it, and, in the same fashion, the API can be extended by developers, if need be.

The [Extend GraphQL API](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/extend-graphql-api) and [Extend Admin Area](/docs/how-to-guides/webiny-cli/scaffolding/extend-admin-area) scaffolds use the same concepts and approaches that are explained in this guide.

### Headless CMS GraphQL API

The **Headless CMS GraphQL API** is a special standalone GraphQL API that is introduced by the Headless CMS application. It's located in the [`api/code/headlessCMS`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/headlessCMS) folder and, like the default GraphQL API, can also be extended by developers.

## Extending GraphQL API

In general, when talking about extending an existing GraphQL API, we're usually referring to one or more of the following:

- adding new [query or mutation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) GraphQL operations
- adding new GraphQL [types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields)
- extending existing GraphQL types with additional [fields](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fields)

For example, we might want to add a new, Page Builder-related, `duplicatePage` mutation, that would be responsible for making copies of provided pages. Or, we might just want to add an extra field to the [`PbPage`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/api-page-builder/src/graphql/graphql/pages.gql.ts#L30) GraphQL type, so that we can store some additional data for each page.

And although, depending on the application and the change we want to perform, some of the steps in the overall GraphQL extension process may differ, in all cases, we will want to start by registering a new [`GraphQLSchemaPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/handler-graphql/src/plugins/GraphQLSchemaPlugin.ts#L10) plugin.

The plugin is registered within your GraphQL API's application code. For example, if we wanted to extend the default GraphQL API, we would create the plugin inside of the [`api/code/graphql/src/plugins`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql/src/plugins) folder, and register it in the [`api/code/graphql/src/index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/graphql/src/index.ts) entrypoint file. On the other hand, if we wanted to extend the Headless CMS GraphQL API, we would create the plugin inside of the [`api/code/headlessCMS/src/plugins`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts) folder, and register it in the [`api/code/headlessCMS/src/plugins/index.ts`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/cwp-template-aws/template/api/code/headlessCMS/src/index.ts) entrypoint file.

:::info
The [`GraphQLSchemaPlugin`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/blob/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/handler-graphql/src/plugins/GraphQLSchemaPlugin.ts#L10) plugin is part of the [`@webiny/handler-graphql`](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/tree/v5.11.0-beta.1/packages/handler-graphql) package, which can also be used to create new standalone GraphQL APIs.
