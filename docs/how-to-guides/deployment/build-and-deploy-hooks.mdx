- how to run custom code before and after build or deploy

## Introduction

Many times it's necessary to run some code before or after build or deployment.
For example, you may want to add some additional logging or validation.

## Creating a hook

With the power of plugins, it's easy to run arbitrary code before and after
the process of build & deployment.

It's as easy as defining a CLI plugin within your `webiny.project.ts`:

```ts title="webiny.project.ts"
// Some of the code is removed for brevity.

export default {
  name: "your-project",
  cli: {
    plugins: [
      // ... all other plugins go here
      {
        type: "hook-before-build",
        name: "my-custom-hook-before-build",
        async hook(args, context) {
          // your code goes here
        }
      },
      {
        type: "hook-after-build",
        name: "my-custom-hook-after-build",
        async hook(args, context) {
          // your code goes here
        }
      },
      {
        type: "hook-before-deploy",
        name: "my-custom-hook-before-deploy",
        async hook(args, context) {
          // your code goes here
        }
      },
      {
        type: "hook-after-deploy",
        name: "my-custom-hook-after-deploy",
        async hook(args, context) {
          // your code goes here
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```
