## Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.6.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.6.0`.
