## Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.5.0"
```

## Upgrade Webiny Project

This release includes a couple of smaller changes on the project organization level. To make it easier, we provide a simple [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli) command that will automatically make all of the necessary adjustments for you.

Once you've run the above upgrade command, run the following:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny upgrade 5.5.0
```

:::info
Before running the `webiny upgrade` command, we recommend that you commit any active code changes you might have in your working branch.
:::

Once the command has finished, your project should be completely updated. You can proceed by committing the changes to your working branch and trying to [deploy](/docs/how-to-guides/deployment/deploy-your-project) the project to one of the development or pre-production environment.
