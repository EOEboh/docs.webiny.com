- how to upgrade Webiny from 5.4.0 to 5.5.0
  :::

:::danger

Before continuing, make sure to take the necessary precautions, listed in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview#-precaution-measures) section.
:::

## Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.5.0"
```

## Upgrade Webiny Project

This release includes a couple of smaller changes on the project organization level. To make it easier, we provide a simple [Webiny CLI](/docs/key-topics/webiny-cli) command that will automatically make all of the necessary adjustments for you.

Once you've run the above upgrade command, run the following:

```bash
yarn webiny upgrade 5.5.0
```

:::info
Before running the `webiny upgrade` command, we recommend that you commit any active code changes you might have in your working branch.
:::

Once the command has finished, your project should be completely updated and you can proceed by committing the changes to your working branch.

### What Changed?

:::info
While it's running, the `webiny upgrade` command will display all of the changes it is performing. Furthermore, once the command has finished, you can also run the `git status` command to retrieve a list of files that were modified in the process.
:::

The following is a list of all changes that the `webiny upgrade` command will perform.

#### 1. Moved `.pulumi` Folders To Project Root

By default, the Pulumi cloud infrastructure [state files](/docs/key-topics/deployment/iac-with-pulumi#state-files) are stored locally - in `.pulumi` folders located in your project applications folders:

```bash
api/.pulumi
apps/admin/.pulumi
apps/website/.pulumi
```

Because of the fact that these files change on every deploy and that interferes with the new `webiny watch` command, we've been forced to move these folders outside of project application folders. So, all of your locally stored cloud infrastructure state files are now located in your project root, inside of the new `.pulumi` folder:

```bash
.pulumi/api/.pulumi
.pulumi/apps/admin/.pulumi
.pulumi/apps/website/.pulumi
```

##### Note about CI/CD workflows

We've seen some users storing the `.pulumi` folders in an internal Amazon S3 bucket in their CI/CD workflows. So, if you're using this approach, make sure to take the new location of the `.pulumi` folders into consideration and adjust your CI/CD logic accordingly.

:::caution
As noted in the [Overview](/docs/how-to-guides/upgrade-webiny/overview#-precaution-measures) section, please test your changes in pre-production environments first.

#### 5. Admin Area / Website - added `watch` command

#### 6. Added new commands for custom packages


Add `"watch": "yarn webiny run watch"` entry to the `scripts` section in every `package.json` file located withing the API project application:
