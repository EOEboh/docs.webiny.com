## Upgrade Webiny Packages

The first step is to upgrade all `@webiny/*` packages, which can be done by running the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn up "@webiny/*@5.8.0"
```

Once the upgrade has finished, running the `yarn webiny --version` command in your terminal should return `5.8.0`.

## Upgrade Headless CMS

### Upgrade the lambda code
Due to some internal changes in how we store data to the database and Elasticsearch you must run the upgrade command to update HeadlessCMS and GraphQL lambda files.

Command to run is:
```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny upgrade 5.8.0
```

When you are done with the upgrade, re-deploy your API code.

```bash
# Execute in your project root.
yarn webiny deploy api --env=YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
```

### Upgrade in the Admin

When your API code deploys, go to your admin url and there should be an upgrade screen.
If upgrade screen does not show, try to clear cookies, local storage and log back in.

:::note
If there is still no upgrade screen, verify that you have done the previous step correctly.
:::

Clicking on the `Upgrade` button will start the upgrade script.
Depending on the amount of the data you have it might take few seconds/minutes to complete.

If you encounter any problems during the upgrade feel free to give us a shout on our [Community Slack #headless-cms](https://webiny-community.slack.com/archives/C0147R8166P) channel.

## Upgrade your custom Elasticsearch plugins

In this version we started using [elastic-ts](https://github.com/jacobwgillespie/elastic-ts) library to have more robust Typescript types for the Elasticsearch queries.
Due to changing from our own types to this library, there is a change that you must do in your custom Elasticsearch plugins which concern the `query`.
If you do not have custom plugins, just disregard this part of the upgrade.

Our `ElasticsearchQuery` type had `mustNot` property, but `elastic-ts` `BoolQueryConfig` has `must_not` property. You need to change that property if you had it in your plugins.
