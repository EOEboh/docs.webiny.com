# Changes



## Elasticsearch

### Customize The Elasticsearch Index Settings And Mappings For Your Deployment ([#2316](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2316))

We added plugins to customize your Elasticsearch Index creation for any of our applications.
To find out more, read [How To Customize Elasticsearch Index](/docs/core-development-concepts/extending-and-customizing/how-to-customize-elasticsearch-index).

### Split The Elasticsearch Index For Each Of The Locales ([#2323](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2323))

We added an option to split each Elasticsearch Index to per-locale one.
In all new Webiny deployments where the Elasticsearch is used, it is the default behavior.

On all old systems, if you want to change how the indexes are created, and change the existing ones, please read [How To Change Elasticsearch Index Name To Contain Locale](/docs/core-development-concepts/extending-and-customizing/how-to-change-elasticsearch-index-name-to-contain-locale).

### Added Japanese Elasticsearch Index Configuration ([#2326](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2326))

We added the Japanese Elasticsearch Index configuration for all of our applications.


## Headless CMS

### Validate Model Name Against The Existing Models ([#2324](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2324))

We added a check in the UI when creating a new model to verify that the model with same name does not exist in the system already.
The check is still being run on the API side, but this way we do not need to call the API to check for the existing model.
