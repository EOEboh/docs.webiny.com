# Changes

## File Manager

### Fixed Tagging of Files ([#2381](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2381))

In some cases, trying to tag an uploaded file in the File Manager would cause the app to break. This has now been addressed.

### Changing the File Upload Limits Is Now Propagated Immediately ([#2385](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2385))

Prior to this release, changes to File Manager settings would not take immediate effect. 

More specifically, if a user tried to upload a file and received the "Max file exceeded." error message, even after incrementing the maximum file upload size limit, and then trying to re-upload the file would not work. Only after a complete page reload the user would be able to continue with the upload.

This has now been addressed. Changes to File Manager settings will take immediate effect and doing a page reload is no longer needed. 

## Development
