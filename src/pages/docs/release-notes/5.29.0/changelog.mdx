# Changes

This release contains lots of important upgrades, from developer experience, to performance improvements, to maintainability. The primary focus of this release is the ability to connect your project to Webiny Control Panel to unlock extra features, analytics, etc. Another important milestone is a completely new approach to building and customizing your project infrastructure using Pulumi. This allowed us to remove _all_ the infrastructure code from the project, making your project easier to understand, maintain, and upgrade.

<Alert type={"info"}>
  
  Note that some of these improvements are only available if you're creating a new project with Webiny 5.29.0. If you're just upgrading from earlier versions, your project will only partially benefit from all the cool stuff that's included in this release. 
  <br/><br/>
  Also note that there's currently no way to completely migrate earlier versions of projects to the new project architecture (new Pulumi, less files, etc.). However, you'll still be getting all the current and future business logic upgrades and fixes, because the business logic is not connected to the architecture itself.

## Webiny Control Panel

// Adrian (a video of CLI login or WCP dashboard maybe?)

## Prerendering Service

### Migrate to Event Driven Architecture ([#2469](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2469))
 - event driven (no cron jobs, less Lambda invocations, immediate re-render)
 - new database records
 - simpler programmatic usage
 - throw 400 when domain can't be mapped to a tenant
 - MT system with just 1 tenant doesn't require a custom domain!

## Project Architecture
 - simpler folder structure and far less files
 - faster build and deploy times
 - less to maintain and easier to upgrade
 - all apps grouped under `apps/` folder
 - abstracted away babel configs for node and react


## Security

### disable auth when loading your own user ([#2489](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2489))
### add a loading overlay while loading identity ([#2490](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2490))
